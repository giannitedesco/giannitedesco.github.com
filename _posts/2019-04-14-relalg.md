## Relations

## Algebra of Bags (aka Multisets)
- union, intersection, difference
- difference and union can only be done on union-compatible relations
- joins are flattened

## Whirldwind Tour of the Operators

### Standard Operators
- Selection $ \sigma_{a = b \, \land \, c = d} $
- Projection $ \Pi_{a,b,c} $
- Cross-join / Cartesian Product $ R_{1} \times R_{2} $
- Inner-join $ R_{1} \Join R_{2} $

### Extended operators
- Group-Aggregate $ \gamma_{g,a} \, R $
- Distinct $ \delta R $

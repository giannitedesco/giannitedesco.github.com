summary: Where we try to convince you that databases are applied theory
---

Today I'll try to hoodwink you, the reader, in to believing what is taught in
many a databases 101 module at university. That is that RDBMS's, like
compilers, are a triumph of applied theory and that this triumph is one of
several delicious fruits of the golden age of computer science.

Back in the golden age of the 70's, our forefathers created elegant theories
before sitting down to write a single line of code. Which of course, they wrote
with pencil and paper. Or, at least, they had a research assistant write it for
them with pencil and paaper.

## Relations
Ah yes, the fabled relation. Not the kind you argue about brexit and
immigration with over christmas dinner. No, this is the kind of elegant
formalism upon which useful, practical systems are built.

## Algebra of Bags (aka Multisets)
- union, intersection, difference
- difference and union can only be done on union-compatible relations
- joins are flattened

## Whirldwind Tour of the Operators

### Standard Operators
- Selection $ \sigma_{a = b \, \land \, c = d} $
- Projection $ \Pi_{a,b,c} $
- Cross-join / Cartesian Product $ R_{1} \times R_{2} $
- Inner-join $ R_{1} \Join R_{2} $

### Extended operators
- Group-Aggregate $ \gamma_{g,a} \, R $
- Distinct $ \delta R $
